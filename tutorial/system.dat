System operations (keyboard input, screen output, host, edit)

The operation "readscreen" displays the string argument as a prompt
and stops, awaiting an entry. It accepts all text typed until the
<RETURN> as the input and assigns it to "Name" as a string.

.n Name gets readscreen 'Please type your name: ';

The operation "read" displays the string argument as a prompt
and stops, awaiting an entry. The text entered is executed, which
causes a string representing numbers to be converted to numbers
or a string representing a Q'Nial expression to be evaluated.

.n X Y gets read 'X Y coordinates (Use 20 20): ' ;
.p
The operation "writescreen" writes a string to the screen. The operation
"write" formats the output to a proper character table for output.

.n writescreen 'Correct answer';
.n write "Coordinates: X Y ;

Other screen oriented operations and expressions

writechars    writes characters without newline
readchar      accepts a single character and does not display it

.p
The host editor is used directly with operation "edit".

    edit <file name>

.p
Host commands can be executed from within Q'Nial.

host 'dir'

host 'dir > temp' ; dir gets getfile "temp; 3 take dir

At the top level loop, the exclamation mark ! can be used instead of "host"
