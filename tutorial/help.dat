                         The Q'Nial Help Facility

Q'Nial is delivered with a help system that provides details on all
the built-in features of the system and language. It can be accessed in
two ways. By the expression "Help" which initiates a loop to provide
access tohelp information, or by the operation "topic" which pops up help
information on a single topic.

We will now enter the Help system using help. The first screen explains
what the help loop does. You will eventually exit Help if you continue
to press <Enter>. Try this now, pressing <Enter> until you return
to this TEACH script.
   Help
.p
.n Help
This time we will look for information on a specific topic. After reaching
the Help loop, respond by typing
                 address<Enter>
This will display a screen on the address concept in Nial.
Press <Enter> then <q> <Enter> to return to this script.
.p
.n Help
The list of help topics can be searched using F2 and F3 as explained
in the initial help screen. When you enter the Help loop this time, 
press <Enter> to get the topic list, press F2, and search for
"pervasive". Use F3 to go on to the second occurrence in the entry 
"binary pervasive".  Press <Enter> to see this topic.
     Help

.n Help
In some contexts we want to display help on a single topic without going
into an elaborate interaction. The operation "topic" is provided to
do this.  We will now use topic to get explanation of the transformer EACH.
     topic "each
.p
.n topic "each

The help facility can be extended for an an application by adding entries
in the nialhelp directory. The Help facility is itself a Nial application
and can be found in the file defs.ndf in the initial subdirectory.
(Use Help to discover what these are).
